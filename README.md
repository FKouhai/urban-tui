# URBAN-TUI
This project was done to toy around with [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and [lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss). <br>
It allows you to query the urban dictionary api and get a definition of the slang you want to know the meaning of.
## How to use it
You can download the tarball from the release according to your OS and CPU architecture <br>
```(bash)
tar xvf urban-tui_tag_os_arch.tar.gz
./urban-tui
```
### Keymaps
